date coded: August 2016

## Directions:

- Create a program that will solve the problem below.
- The program must written in the C programming language, using only the following libraries stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h
- The program must compile using standard Linux GCC

Create a program such that given a number n and a sequence of numbers, the program should determine if the sequence of numbers is a stack permutation of the sequence 1â€¦n


## Sample Input:

10:3, 5, 4, 8, 9, 10, 7, 6, 2, 1
